 Implementing constrained optimization method simulated annealing

## About

This experiment uses the simulated annealing algorithm to solve the flow shop scheduling. Each workpiece needs to go through $$m$$ processes in sequence, and each process requires different machines to process and each machine can only process one workpiece at the same time. A workpiece cannot be processed on different machines at the same time and the processing time of each workpiece on each machine is given. According to the data provided in the document, arrange the processing sequence of m machines to process n workpieces, and ask to find the shortest processing time as much as possible. The simulated annealing algorithm is used to minimize the total work span, and a scheduling scheme is given, that is, the optimal processing sequence of $$n$$ workpieces on $$m$$ machines.
